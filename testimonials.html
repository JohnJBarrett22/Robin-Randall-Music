          <p class="testimonial_para">Robin really took the time to understand our daughter&#x27;s strengths and weaknesses to determine how best to approach improving her piano playing. She didn&#x27;t just teach out of a book, rather she worked on the fundamentals that are needed in order to build a firm foundation. Elise likes her as a teacher and was very attentive through the whole lesson.</p>

Not only was Robin extremely helpful and professional, but she also became a good friend. After I stopped taking weekly lessons, Robin still provided me with wonderful opportunities and always put out a good word for me. I felt like Robin always had my best interest in mind and really started my love for songwriting. I would definitely recommend Robin for anyone seeking help and I am extremely great-full to call her one of my mentors!</p>

          <p class="testimonial_para">Inspiring<br><br>Robin teaches two of my children in our home. She arrives on time and is easy to communicate with when conflicts arrive. More importantly we had an 8 year old boy that passionately rallied against taking piano lessons. It was a struggle to get him to agree to even make an effort on the first try. Then he met Robin. In a single lesson he was inspired to not only continue but started working on a song he wanted to compose. Now we are several months in and both children eagerly anticipate their weekly lessons with Robin. I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</p>

          <p class="testimonial_para">A caring teacher<br><br>I came to MI a music student who was placed at a level that was below me since I had already studied a lot of theory and ear training in my home town. But Robin still made it interesting for me and she taught me a lot of new ways to use the knowledge I already had into something that I had never tried before.<br><br>Robin has something that a lot of music teachers seem to lack and that is actually caring about what she does and caring about her students. I took songwriting with her when I was getting closer and closer to graduation and I was scared of what was waiting for me. With Robin&#x27;s hands on teaching methods and frankly just believing in me, she showed me that I had nothing to worry about. I owe it to her that I&#x27;m able to live off doing music today and every time somebody asks me who they should pick as their teachers, I always tell them to go to Robin&#x27;s class. If it wasn&#x27;t for her encouraging me, I would&#x27;ve given up and gone home a long time ago.<br><br>Thank you Robin</p>

I was lucky enough to have her also as a private songwriting teacher. Taking these three classes at the same time with Robin helped me understand my compositions, and understand myself as a musician. She constantly encourages students to be creative and original. I have had songwriting teachers that push students to write according to the music commercial trends. Robin instead is open to different sounds that are more interesting musically.<br>‍<br>I have never before had a teacher that believes in her students so much that not only helps them become better musicians but also, helps build confidence though our work.</p>

She was so easy to talk to and always had great ideas for my songs whenever I was experiencing writer&#x27;s block or couldn&#x27;t figure out which chords to use. (She is the chord queen after all). She&#x27;s so clever when it comes to music and songwriting and she taught me such great techniques that I still use now. On top of being amazing at what she does, Robin is such a sweet person too. I&#x27;d recommend her without hesitation to anyone looking for a songwriting teacher. She&#x27;s the best!</p>

          <p class="testimonial_para">Robin is great!<br><br>Robin is a wonderful piano and music theory teacher. She is a pro who knows how to inspire students to be the best they can be. Her experience and expertise are immense, yet she is amazingly patient, calming and motivating.<br>Robin has helped me reach levels of music that I don&#x27;t think I would have with any other teacher because of her vast experience. I highly recommend Robin for anyone who wants to take music seriously and to the professional level.</p>

          <p class="testimonial_para">The Real Deal with Love<br><br>Robin has so much to offer as a songwriter and musician - years of experiences in the real world with real world success. She approaches her students with affection and gently prods them towards development. She is always encouraging and always has a story that will inspire and teach. My only regret is that I only scraped the surface in our short course together. Robin is a very talented and lovely person as well as a great teacher.</p>

          <p class="testimonial_para">Guide To Your Own Talent<br><br>I started working with Robin after having taken a class with her at Dick Grove School of Music many years back. I could tell that as an instructor, she cared deeply for music and for her students, and so I approached her for private instruction in helping me to craft and shape songs that I had been working on. What I found in her was an absolute dedication to helping me find what it was I was looking for in each tune that I wrote, and a positive motivator to finding ways to tell compelling stories and expressions of feeling in the melodies and words that I chose for each project. The nearly impossible trick to choosing good instructors is to find those who know their artistry very well, who are able to explain and guide their students towards their own expansion of growth, and who truly love their craft and that act of teaching it. Inexplicably, Robin Randall is all of these things in one person.</p>

          <p class="testimonial_para">INSPIRED, ACTION<br><br>We first met Robin at our Valley View Elementary where she was in charge of the after school music program. She taught piano, vocals, and songwriting to my daughter from ages 9-11 and then to my twins while they were ages 6-8. Robin has immense patience and diligence and kind hearted listening skills. She made songwriting and piano easy and fun and integrated this talent into the lives of all three girls outside of just the class environment. Robin led a group of all instruments and voices for school shows. She created a professional studio recording and video for the groups and individuals. We love Robin dearly are blessed to know her and highly recommend her teaching!</p>

          <p class="testimonial_para">AMAZING Teacher!<br><br>Robin is known as the Chord Queen and theres a reason. When you ask about her at Musicians Institute both teachers and students know her name and have good things to say about her. There is no one like her.<br><br>There´s a reason I requested her as my Artist Development Instructor. For my band Anna and the Bells, she has been our guide, a part of the band. We came to her first with our music and still do. For our song Expiration dating, she helped us get to the roots and gave us chords to work with from the era we were looking for. With her harmony &amp;theory knowledge, songwriting and own experience, she gives you all she´s got. If we need advice, we go to her. Not only is she incredibly talented when it comes to music and lyrics, she´s also caring about her students and does her best to help them. All in all, an amazing teacher. You´re lucky if you get to call her yours.</p>

She understands music, the music business, and has great connections, and opens new opportunities when her students are moving forward. She is vary patient as well. She deals with my special needs son like no one else has ever been able to. She draws things out of him, piques his curiosity, and is SO VERY encouraging. We love her so much, and she has meant the world to my son&#x27;s growth in music and composition. He looks forward to his lessons with her because she is cheerful and has a special way of engaging young people that I wish EVERY music teacher possessed.</p>

        <p class="testimonial_para">Robin really took the time to understand our daughter&#x27;s strengths and weaknesses to determine how best to approach improving her piano playing. She didn&#x27;t just teach out of a book, rather she worked on the fundamentals that are needed in order to build a firm foundation. Elise likes her as a teacher and was very attentive through the whole lesson.</p>

From the start, Robin has really listened to what my goals are and has been helping me meet them - she&#x27;s very personable and encouraging, and gives me manageable goals. 100% recommended!</p>

        <p class="testimonial_para">Excellent teacher<br><br>As a young singer/songwriter I wanted to learn from someone who I felt like knew what they were doing. Not only was Robin extremely helpful and professional, but she also became a good friend. After I stopped taking weekly lessons, Robin still provided me with wonderful opportunities and always put out a good word for me. I felt like Robin always had my best interest in mind and really started my love for songwriting. I would definitely recommend Robin for anyone seeking help and I am extremely great-full to call her one of my mentors!</p>

Robin makes piano playing fun and stress free. She is always thinking of ways to keep him motivated in learning, including writing songs together during his lessons. With Robin, my son has learned music theory and the structure of contemporary song writing in a fun way. She is a very dedicated teacher.</p>

        <p class="testimonial_para">Inspiring<br><br>Robin teaches two of my children in our home. She arrives on time and is easy to communicate with when conflicts arrive. More importantly we had an 8 year old boy that passionately rallied against taking piano lessons. It was a struggle to get him to agree to even make an effort on the first try. Then he met Robin. In a single lesson he was inspired to not only continue but started working on a song he wanted to compose. Now we are several months in and both children eagerly anticipate their weekly lessons with Robin. I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</p>

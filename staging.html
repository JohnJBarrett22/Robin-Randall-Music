  <p><strong><br>Robin Randall was born and raised in Hollywood. After graduating from the Dick Grove School of Music, she spent eight years on the faculty. As a writer, she got her first break co-writing the hit song “Tomorrow Doesn’t Matter Tonight” for Starship, going on to write songs for domestic and international recording artists, including ABBA, Mark Free and Australian band Roxus. Her other credits include songs for “Baywatch,” the ABC TV movie The Amy Fisher Story and NBC reality show “Starting Over.” As an author, Robin co-wrote Lead Sheet Bible (Hal Leonard Publishing).In 2007, she was voted a Top-20 finalist in the “American Idol” songwriting competition and also contributed to songwriting on Idol finalist Brooke White’s CD Songs from the Attic. Robin has been a music judge for the Emmy Awards since 1997.At MI, she teaches Songwriting, Theory and Artist Development.</strong></p>

Classical, jazz, contemporary, pop, rock, R&amp;B, folk, current, American Song Book, and of course...the Beatles!</p>
  <p>I&#x27;ve been a songwriter since I was a teenager. I have been teaching music for almost as long. As a teacher, my joy comes from seeing a student realize they have grown, or discover something they now can do that they could not do before, and the confidence gained through their efforts with my guidance. I carry around the Beatles Pocket Reference Guide at all times and preach the gospel of their songwriting legacy to my students when necessary and whenever possible!! I equally love the mystery of the musical ear, and music theory, and how it all works together...I love purple. For all those who know me, I always match in whatever color spectrum I decide for that day, and I always have been that way. I believe in Angels on Earth, I searched for the Lochness Monster (No luck!!) I love animals. I have 2 rescue dogs, and 3 rescue cats, 1 more comes to have dinner and hang out. I named my son after the musical &quot;Oliver&quot; and the name suits him! I like that Oliver means &quot; peace offering&quot; I grew up in the Hollywood Hills, and love the history of Hollywoodland, I also love music and TV history. My uncle Sherwood co wrote 2 of the most iconic TV themes of all time in GIlligan&#x27;s Island theme and the Brady Bunch. My mom, (Judithe) and I wrote songs together for 25 years. I named my first publishing company after my dog, Atso and he was the president and his legacy lives on in his name.<br><br>Employment History / Credits<br><br>Songwriting School of Los Angeles 2010- present<br>Musicians Institute 1992-present<br>Los Angeles County High School for the Arts (LACHSA) 2013 - present<br>Neighborhood Rock School 2013- present<br>Dick Grove School of Music 1985-1992<br>LA Recording Workshop 1998-2005<br>The Baywatch Production Co / Fremantle Media 1989-1999<br><br>Education:<br><br>Dick Grove School of Music<br><br>Composition Program 1982-1983<br>Keyboard Program 1983-1984<br><br>Hollywood High School 1979<br>Honors in Music and History<br><br>ATAS member since 1997<br>Emmy judge for 15 years<br><br>Platinum Hit :&quot; Tomorrow Doesn&#x27;t Matter Tonight&quot; Starship /RCA Records<br>&quot;The Last Time&quot; Agnetha Faltskog (ABBA) / WEA Records<br>Gold: &quot;Where Are You Now&quot; Roxus / Austrailia / Mushroom Records<br>Wrote numerous songs for TV show &quot;Baywatch&quot; 1989-1999<br>Songs /music in various TV movies, reality shows, films 1979-current<br>Collaborated with American Idol Top 5 finalist Brooke White<br>American Idol songwriting contest finalist 2007 / Jordin Sparks year<br>Co authored Music Book &quot;The Lead Sheet Bible&quot; A step by step guide to doing lead sheets and chord charts, published by Hal Leonard Publ. 1998<br><br><br><br>*** Lesson Details ***<br>To me every student is unique and special, therefore I design the lesson around what they need and or want to learn. With the younger students, I strongly suggest we work out of a book as well as me giving them handouts to work on too. There are many and various books by Faber and Faber I love to use. Hal Leonard and Alfred Publishing have some great books depending on the students needs. With kids, it&#x27;s important to keep it fun and interesting, and get them on a practice schedule. I believe one must have much patience with the younger students and the level of communication must be high, keeping them engaged and focused. With teens and adults, it depends on where they are at, and I always ask what they want to concentrate on. A well rounded piano lesson would work on reading, technique, theory, songs. Again, depending on the type of student, the lesson would incorporate more /and or less of these components.<br>I&#x27;ve been coined the &quot;Chord Queen&quot; by many students because of my fascination with how theory plays a subconscious role in songwriters who write by ear and if I&#x27;m teaching songwriting, we are looking at how the song is structured, the lyrics,the music, and of course the harmony and arrangement and I&#x27;m here to guide the student to be able to finish the song, and them be happy when it comes to fruition.<br><br>The subjects I&#x27;ve taught:<br><br>Piano<br>Theory<br>Ear Training<br>Songwriting/ Artist Development<br>Music History<br>Transcribing/Chord Charts/Lead Sheets<br>Music Publishing/Copyright<br><br>*** Studio Equipment ***<br>I have a piano I teach at in my home, I have a photo copy machine to make copies and Wifi access if the student needs to bring their computer.Ipad, etc in regards to songwriting<br><br>*** Travel Equipment ***<br>I can bring music/paper/pens/pencils/hand outs/sheet music<br>Students should have piano/keyboard/Access to computer, or ipad would be helpful for research,examples. Lots of people have their music on their cell phones.<br><br>*** Specialties ***<br>Mostly Contemporary music,but have taught in many styles<br>pop/Rock/Country/Jazz/Soul genres</p>

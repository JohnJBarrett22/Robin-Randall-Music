      <p>I have worked with Robin on piano, songwriting and theory. She is extremely knowledgable while also being totally approachable. I am so thankful to get to study with Robin. She has helped me elevate creatively!</p>

      <p>Robin really took the time to understand our daughter&#x27;s strengths and weaknesses to determine how best to approach improving her piano playing. She didn&#x27;t just teach out of a book, rather she worked on the fundamentals that are needed in order to build a firm foundation. Elise likes her as a teacher and was very attentive through the whole lesson.</p>

      <p>I was a bit nervous to start taking lessons again after a VERY long hiatus. From the start, Robin has really listened to what my goals are and has been helping me meet them - she&#x27;s very personable and encouraging, and gives me manageable goals. 100% recommended!</p>

      <p>My favourite songwriting teacher<br><br>I studied at Musicians Institute with Robin. Out of the many teachers I learnt from. She was my favorite songwriting mentor. I couldn&#x27;t have asked for better. I graduated in March 2013 and till date I cannot forget her part in my music career.</p>

      <p>True Passion<br><br>I had the pleasure to study with Robin just about one 1 year ago and I was really surprise to see how much passion in music you could perceive through his teaching. I achieved great result with her and can&#x27;t be thankful enough</p>

      <p>Inspiring Mentor<br><br>Robin is one of the best music teachers I have had. She taught me Music Theory and Ear Training at Musicians Institute in Hollywood. I was lucky enough to have her also as a private songwriting teacher. Taking these three classes at the same time with Robin helped me understand my compositions, and understand myself as a musician. She constantly encourages students to be creative and original. I have had songwriting teachers that push students to write according to the music commercial trends. Robin instead is open to different sounds that are more interesting musically.<br>I have never before had a teacher that believes in her students so much that not only helps them become better musicians but also, helps build confidence though our work.</p>

      <p>Amazingly talented teacher and mentor<br><br>I was a student of Robin&#x27;s for a couple years at the Musicians Institute and of all the teachers I had there, she was the one who had the biggest impact on me. She was so easy to talk to and always had great ideas for my songs whenever I was experiencing writer&#x27;s block or couldn&#x27;t figure out which chords to use. (She is the chord queen after all). She&#x27;s so clever when it comes to music and songwriting and she taught me such great techniques that I still use now. On top of being amazing at what she does, Robin is such a sweet person too. I&#x27;d recommend her without hesitation to anyone looking for a songwriting teacher. She&#x27;s the best!</p>

      <p>The Real Deal with Love<br><br>Robin has so much to offer as a songwriter and musician - years of experiences in the real world with real world success. She approaches her students with affection and gently prods them towards development. She is always encouraging and always has a story that will inspire and teach. My only regret is that I only scraped the surface in our short course together. Robin is a very talented and lovely person as well as a great teacher.</p>

      <p>Guide to Your Own Talent<br><br>I started working with Robin after having taken a class with her at Dick Grove School of Music many years back. I could tell that as an instructor, she cared deeply for music and for her students, and so I approached her for private instruction in helping me to craft and shape songs that I had been working on. What I found in her was an absolute dedication to helping me find what it was I was looking for in each tune that I wrote, and a positive motivator to finding ways to tell compelling stories and expressions of feeling in the melodies and words that I chose for each project. The nearly impossible trick to choosing a good instructor is to find someone who knows their artistry very well, who is able to explain and guide their students towards his or her own expansion of growth, and who is an instructor that both truly loves their craft and that act of teaching it. Inexplicably, Robin all of these things in one person.</p>

      <p>INSPIRED,ACTION<br><br>We first met Robin at our Valley View Elementary where she was in charge of the after school music program. She taught piano, vocals, and songwriting to my daughter from ages 9-11 and then to my twins while they were ages 6-8. Robin has immense patience and diligence and kind hearted listening skills. She made songwriting and piano easy and fun and integrated this talent into the lives of all three girls outside of just the class environment. Robin led a group of all instruments and voices for school shows. She created a professional studio recording and video for the groups and individuals. We love Robin dearly are blessed to know her and highly recommend her teaching!</p>

      <p>AMAZING Teacher!<br><br>Robin is known as the Chord Queen and theres a reason. When you ask about her at Musicians Institute both teachers and students know her name and have good things to say about her. There is no one like her.<br><br>There´s a reason I requested her as my Artist Development Instructor. For my band Anna and the Bells, she has been our guide, a part of the band. We came to her first with our music and still do. For our song Expirationdating, she helped us get to the roots and gave us chords to work with from the era we were looking for. With her harmony&amp;theory knowledge, songwriting and own experience, she gives you all she´s got. If we need advice, we go to her. Not only is she incredibly talented when it comes to music and lyrics, she´s also caring about her students and does her best to help them. All in all, an amazing teacher. You´re lucky if you get to call her yours.</p>

      <p>THE BEST OF THE BEST<br><br>Robin is a fantastic person, an accomplished musician, and ON TOP OF THAT, is a wonderful teacher. She understands music, the music business, and has great connections, and opens new opportunities when her students are moving forward. She is vary patient as well. She deals with my special needs son like no one else has ever been able to. She draws things out of him, piques his curiosity, and is SO VERY encouraging. We love her so much, and she has meant the world to my son&#x27;s growth in music and composition. He looks forward to his lessons with her because she is cheerful and has a special way of engaging young people that I wish EVERY music teacher possessed.</p>

      <p>Great Teacher!<br><br>Robin is a fabulous piano teacher! She&#x27;s been teaching my six-year-old daughter for about five months now. She&#x27;s very patient and uses positive reinforcement to encourage and motivate her students. She&#x27;s making piano lessons fun, while teaching practical skills and music theory at the same time.</p>

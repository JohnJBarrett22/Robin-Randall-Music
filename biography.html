      <h1 class="section_h2">Robin Randall Bio</h1>
      <p>Robin Randall was born and raised in Hollywood, California. She grew up in the Bronson Canyon of Hollywoodland, known for movie stars homes, Bat Caves and hiking trails. She is of Russian and English descent and grew up in a Hollywood family famous for comedy and the beach, having a grandfather, Al Schwartz, who came here in 1937 to write for any comedian who’d listen to him and ended up working as Bob Hope’s head writer. His little brother whom followed in his footsteps, Robin’s great uncle Sherwood Schwartz went on to create the shows Gilligan’s Island and the Brady Bunch and also wrote their theme songs! Robin’s uncle Doug Schwartz and her cousin Michael Berk created Baywatch which will figure into Robin’s history later.<br><br>Robin always had a fondness for music and songs. Her first red vinyl record was Disney’s Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. She played it on her grandparents’ old victrola till they got her her own record player.<br><br>Having had severe allergies and Asthma in her childhood, she was unable to go play sports in school, nor get around many animals, and she loved animals. She spent lots of time in ERs having Adrenaline shots. She’d be up all night listening to the radio, and the greatest hits of the day. KHJ radio in LA became her favorite pastime and would go over to her friend/ babysitter’s house, Linda’s, across the street and they’d spend countless hours listening and hoping for their favorite songs to come on. They even started a little homemade neighborhood band when Robin was age 7. She played lead triangle!<br><br>Shortly after that she gravitated toward the piano where she’d pluck around the keys till her grandparents started formal lessons at age 10. She took from a genius teacher named Guy Holtz in Studio City and would study with him for the next 12 years. The piano became her muse, her comfort, her confidence.<br><br>Robin would play piano for the drama class in her Le Conte middle school in Hollywood when the regular piano player could not be there. She ended up playing a version of Love Can Keep Us Together and got a slot in the school variety show and went on to win actress of the year in 9th grade drama class.<br><br>Robin’s interest turned from acting and music to strictly music when she transitioned into Hollywood high school. She so loved being in the stage band and music theory<br><br>Robin was raised by her maternal grandparents as her mom was too ill to take care of her. She saw her biological parents on occasion, but her grandparent’s big house on Hollyridge Drive was where she lived and thrived.<br><br>When Robin was 10, she also asked if she could have allergy shots to possibly help her severe allergies. What kid wants a shot? But Robin’s love for animals could not be dismissed. Robin ended up taking shots for 9 years and finally adopted her first dog from the Hollywood Recycler newspaper at age 20. Her beloved Atso lived till he was 17 years old. She even named her publishing company after him. Throughout her life, Robin had rescued dogs and cats and they are the gems of her life.<br><br>Robin’s mother Judithe eventually improved health wise and they became close when Robin was a teenager. Judithe was a self taught painter, poet, lyricist, Astrologer and calligrapher. Robin and Judithe began working on songs together and that was the beginning of a mother-daughter songwriting duo for the next 25 years until Judithe passed away in 2002.<br><br>During their heyday, they wrote many songs in the melodic rock style of the 80s and gained a bit of a following and reputation for writing this style music. They were extremely fortunate to have amazing demo singers who were super talented and she feels very grateful to have had them be the voice on her songs. Singers frequenting the Randall tunes were Diana DeWitt, Marcie Free, Aina, James Christian, Steve Zell, Kristina Nichols, and Ronee Martin. Robin also has collaborated with singers and other songwriters both on her own and with Judithe through the years. Her frequent collaborators were Tony Sciuto, Jeff Law, Nancy Krasn, Steve Zell and James Butler. She wrote a couple songs with Marcie Free and Judithe, as well as with James Christian. Her and Diana DeWitt formed their duo band Venus &amp; Mars while on The Gods of AOR tour in the fall of 1993, where they got inspired to write songs together in hotel rooms and trains. The result was the Grand Trine Album released in 1995 produced by songwriter, guitarist Guy Marshall with a couple tracks added and produced by James Christian.. They got some notice from Japanese Record Company JVC/Avex Trax and soon Were to release their 2nd album, New Moon Rising.<br><br>Alas, Venus and Mars was short lived as collaborator Diana DeWitt’s life took a different course as she moved to Nashville and settled down there until in recent years returning to LA.<br><br>In 1989 Robin and Judithe’s work with Baywatch began and continued through the late 90s having written many songs for Baywatch montages.<br><br>Robin and Judithe throughout the 80s and 90s had songs placed in films and TV and recorded by artists.<br><br>Robin’s biggest success came in 1985 with the release of a song co-written by Steven Cristol called Tomorrow Doesn’t Matter Tonight, recorded by the band the Starship, 3rd single from the Platinum record Knee Deep In The Hoopla. The song reached 26 on the national pop charts, and 22 here in LA on Kiss FM and America’s Top 40. The video for the song was Top Ten MTV. The album stayed on the top of the charts for months.<br><br>Robin is also a longtime teacher and fell into it without setting out to. She began teaching at Dick Grove School of Music not long after she graduated and stayed there for 8 years, until it closed. She then moved over to Musicians Institute where she has taught for 28 years and still teaches there today. Robin also teaches at the Songwriting School of Los Angeles for the last 10 years.<br><br>Robin co penned an instructional book on how to do chord charts and lead sheets called the Lead Sheet Bible published by Hal Leonard Publishing in 1998.<br><br>After Robin’s mother Judithe passed, it was surreal and confusing as Robin had mainly written with Judithe her teenage and whole adult life. It was difficult to pick up the pieces and continue. At the same time, the music business was changing a lot. Robin found a new collaborator in guitarist and songwriter Bill La Fleur in 2005. They have written many songs between 2005 and 2017.<br><br>In recent times, Robin has found herself more of a mentor and a collaborator of up and coming young artists trying to find their way and sound. She enjoys teaching her students at the college as well as her young piano students up until Covid hit, and she someday will continue to teach them in the future.<br><br>Meanwhile Robin enjoys spending time with her 22 year old son Oliver whom she raised as a single mom, and her fur babies Serena, Mac, Mewzy and Boris: 2 Dogs, 2 cats.<br><br>Robin is an avid doll collector and loves Madame Alexander dolls of the 1960s and 70s.</p>
